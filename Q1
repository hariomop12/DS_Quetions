## Introduction
Data manipulation is a fundamental task in any data science or programming project. In this guide, we'll explore how to read and write different types of datasets using Python. Let's dive in!

## 1. Reading and Writing Text and CSV Files

### Reading a Text File from Disk
```python
def read_text_file(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        content = file.read()
    return content
```

### Writing Content to a Text File
```python
def write_text_file(file_path, content):
    with open(file_path, 'w') as file:
        file.write(content)
```

### Reading a CSV File from Disk (using pandas)
```python
import pandas as pd

def read_csv_file(file_path):
    df = pd.read_csv(file_path)
    return df
```

### Writing a pandas DataFrame to a CSV File
```python
def write_csv_file(df, file_path):
    df.to_csv(file_path, index=False)
```

## 2. Reading Excel Data Sheets in Python

### Reading an Excel File from Disk (using pandas)
```python
def read_excel_file(file_path, sheet_name):
    df = pd.read_excel(file_path, sheet_name=sheet_name)
    return df
```

### Writing a pandas DataFrame to an Excel File
```python
def write_excel_file(df, file_path, sheet_name):
    df.to_excel(file_path, sheet_name=sheet_name, index=False)
```

## 3. Reading XML Datasets in Python

### Reading an XML File from Disk (using ElementTree)
```python
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET

def read_xml_file(file_path):
    tree = ET.parse(file_path)
    root = tree.getroot()
    return root
```

*Note*: To write XML data, you can create an ElementTree and add elements to it programmatically. Then, use `tree.write('output.xml')` to save the XML to a file.
